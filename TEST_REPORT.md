## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Phase 2)

1. **Execute P0 Tests** (6.5 hours)
   - Backend authentication tests
   - Backend chat tests
   - Security tests
   - Manual API testing

2. **Achieve Minimum Coverage** (85%+)
   - Write missing test cases
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Document edge cases

3. **Setup CI Integration**
   - Enable automated test runs
   - Add coverage reporting
   - Enforce coverage thresholds

### Short-term Actions (Phase 1 Completion)

1. Write P1 tests (database, integration, mobile services)
2. Perform manual end-to-end testing
3. Execute security scans
4. Document all bugs and fixes

### Long-term Actions (Phase 2+)

1. Add E2E tests with Playwright
2. Implement performance testing
3. Setup continuous security scanning
4. Create test dashboards
